Git Commands
Version control: This is also known as source control and it is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

The difference between Git and GitHub: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

GitHub alternatives:

Gitlab
BitBucket
AWS CodeCommit
The difference between git fetch and git pull: Git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.

Explain git rebase: Git Rebase is one of two Git utilities designed to integrate changes from one branch onto another. Rebasing is the process of combining or moving a sequence of commits on top of a new base commit. Git rebase is the linear process of merging.

The command for Git rebase: Here is a summary of the commands used for Git rebase;

git rebase --d The commit gets discarded from the final combined commit block during playback.
git rebase --p This leaves the commit alone, not modifying the content or message, and keeping it as an individual commit in the branches’ history.
git rebase --x This executes a command line shell script for each marked commit during playback.
git status Checks the rebase status.
git rebase --continue Continue with the changes that you made.
git rebase --skip skip the changes.
Explain cherry-picking: Cherry-picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.

The command for cherry-picking: git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
